# Lab2-HTML

This project is a well-structured HTML5 webpage that showcases the use of semantic elements such as `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<aside>`, and `<footer>`. It also features an HTML5 contact form with built-in validation for inputs like name, email, and message. The project demonstrates best practices in modern web development and accessibility.
